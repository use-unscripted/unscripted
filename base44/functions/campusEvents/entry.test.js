/**
 * A thin in-repo net under the campusEvents iCal parser.
 *
 * ## Read this before adding to it
 *
 * **This file is NOT the test suite for this function.** The real one is 50
 * Deno tests that live outside the repo, and they are the authority on every
 * decision this parser makes — including several deliberate ones that look like
 * bugs until you read them (a mismatched-form exclusion drops the whole series;
 * a `Z`-stamped series pins the UTC clock across a clock change). Searching
 * inside this repo finds no tests for this file, and that conclusion is wrong.
 *
 *   cd ~/.claude/projects/-Users-drewlynch-AI-Projects-Unscripted/campus-sweep
 *   ENTRY=<path-to>/base44/functions/campusEvents/entry.ts \
 *     deno test --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --allow-write --allow-sys \
 *       --node-modules-dir=auto ical.test.ts submitted-url.test.ts
 *
 * `--node-modules-dir=auto` is not optional. See `docs/campus-events.md`.
 *
 * **Any change to entry.ts has to run both suites.** This one exists only
 * because the external one is invisible to `npm test`, so a regression in a
 * production-touching backend function could otherwise reach `main` with a
 * green run behind it. It deliberately does not restate what the 50 cover — it
 * holds the behaviours added since they were written, plus a check that the
 * module still loads at all.
 *
 * The all-day tests below go through `fetchEvents` and the request-time gate,
 * not just the parser, on purpose. A parser-only test is what let a half-fix
 * ship green in 2026-08-03 while it was losing real listings.
 *
 * ## How it loads a Deno function under Node
 *
 * `entry.ts` imports the SDK by `npm:` specifier and ends in `Deno.serve`,
 * neither of which Node can take. The file is read, those two are removed, the
 * TypeScript is stripped, and the rest is imported as an ordinary module.
 * Nothing in the deployed file changes to make this possible.
